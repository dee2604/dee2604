## Hi there 👋 I'm Deeksha Agrawal

I’m a **Senior Android Engineer** with 8+ years of experience building scalable and secure mobile apps in the **e-commerce** and **fintech** domains.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - A **Reminder App** with Jetpack Compose + Google Calendar sync
  - An **Android Performance Metrics Library** to monitor CPU, RAM, and GPU in real-time
  - A **modular, version-independent Shopify integration** using proxy endpoints (POC success 🚀)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - **Ai in Android**. 
  - **Baseline Profiles** and app startup optimization techniques
  - Advanced **Jetpack Compose testing** and Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Open-source Android libraries & performance profiling tools
  - Cross-platform architecture with Compose Multiplatform / KMM

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with:
  - Best practices for multi-module Compose projects
  - Optimizing CI/CD for monorepos with backend + mobile pipelines

- 💬 Ask me about:
  - Android Architecture (MVVM, Clean Architecture)
  - Jetpack Compose, GraphQL, Kotlin Coroutines
  - Firebase, Retrofit, Hilt, Jenkins, SonarQube
